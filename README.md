ðŸ¤– A predictive model capable of analyzing children's physical activity data to detect early indicators of problematic internet and technology use.<br>
 This model was made by some of the [MLV Research Group](http://mlv.cs.duth.gr) members for the [Child Mind Institute Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/child-mind-institute-problematic-internet-use/overview) that was focusing on problematic internet usage by children and adolescents, which took place in Kaggle. **Our place in the final Leaderboard was 180th out of 3560 Teams (You can find us by the team name MLV Team or by clicking here [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/child-mind-institute-problematic-internet-use/leaderboard?search=MLV+Team))!!**
